<h2>Sort Visualizer</h2>
<p>The Sorting Visualizer is an interactive project I've developed to graphically depict various sorting algorithms. It allows users to gain a visual understanding of how different sorting methods operate by showing the sorting process in real-time. Users can choose from algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort to see the data being sorted step-by-step. This makes it an excellent educational tool for students and developers looking to enhance their comprehension of algorithmic logic and efficiency.
To create the Sorting Visualizer, i had to set up a straightforward HTML structure for the visual display, style the visualization components with CSS, and i used JavaScript to implement the sorting algorithms and animate the sorting process.</p>
